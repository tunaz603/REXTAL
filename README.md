# REXTAL
I have recently devised a new computational method called Regional Extension of Assemblies Using Linked-Reads (REXTAL) for improved region-specific assembly of segmental duplication-containing DNA, leveraging inexpensive genomic short-read datasets generated from large DNA molecules partitioned and barcoded using the “Gel Bead in Emulsion” (GEM) microfluidic method.
